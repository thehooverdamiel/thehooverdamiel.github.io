title: So What's With The Blog?

After graduating from Eastern Michigan University with my BS in Computer Science, I worked in the Detroit area for a software-as-a-service company, LevelSet Solutions. Getting my feet under me as a new grad I got my basics up to speed, migrating from junior dev to full member of the team over my 18 months with LevelSet. 

I spent most of that time learning how valuable it is to have patient and kind people sitting the next desk over- I picked up Wordpress and Ruby on Rails, with tons of help from other engineers who remembered what it was like to step into your first development job. 

With nothing but a few dollars in the bank and a naive glimmer in my eye, I left that job in February of 2017 and moved, jobless, 600 miles away to Asheville, NC. After a couple joyful months of sloth, I joined a shop developing software for Sage X3, using deeply cumbersome X3Script to blow away what our clients assumed construction management software was limited to. 

That shop eventually failed to win new development contracts and laid off all but a handful of their engineering team six months after I joined them, casting what had been a group of very talented and supportive people to join disparate teams across the country. 

I'm still living in Asheville and determined to make it work for me, despite the city not being so much a hub of software engineering jobs for anyone still in the first half-decade of their career. I'm working in a deli part time, to my horror, and spending my free time shaping up my development skills while I find where my next software job will be. 

So if you find yourself thinking, "so what's with the blog?", I hope this answers your question: if I keep track of my work and where it's taking me, I'm going to be more focused and ultimately build more confidence as a developer. Which strikes me as pretty worthwhile, all said and done.
