# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  After losing a job working in archaic and terrible X3Script, I decided to spend a much
  larger chunk of my time developing my skills as a developer, rather than waiting for
  the right work to come to me. This is my blog where I keep track of what I'm working on
  and what I'm learning along the way. 
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://thehooverdamiel.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
github_username:  thehooverdamiel
